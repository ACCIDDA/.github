# Atlantic Coast Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics and Analytics (ACCIDDA)

Welcome to the Atlantic Coast Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics and Analytics (ACCIDDA) GitHub organization!

ACCIDDA is devoted to rapid, coordinated response to infectious disease threats through innovative modeling techniques, enhanced data integration, and training a new generation of public health experts. By prioritizing predictive analytics relevant to smaller, often overlooked populations—particularly rural communities—ACCIDDA ensures that local public health decisions are informed by comprehensive insights. As the Insight Net coordinating center, ACCIDDA fosters collaboration and readiness across the network through network-wide meetings, tech transfer workshops, and modeling challenges.

# Project Highlights

## AI Tools

We use a variety of cutting edge AI techniques in our work. The publicly released ones include:

 - [influpaint](https://github.com/jcblemai/influpaint) uses a novel "[inpainting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting#Digital_inpainting)" technique to generate infectious disease trends.

## Dashboards

Rapid visualization of operationally-relevant trends is key to decision-making and is a routine part of our work. In additional to custom products, we also have publicly available examples like:

 - [RespiLens](https://github.com/ACCIDDA/RespiLens) provides a flexible dashboard for respiratory disease trends; [check it out here](https://www,respilens.com)!

## Decision Support

Our work on infectious disease modeling focuses on turning analysis into better outcomes. To that end, we make tools that commodify complex calculations and pipeline frameworks to reduce overhead of big-data analyses. Some of those tools include:

 - [tti](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/tti/) provides a simple calculator to evaluate Test-Trace-Isolate interventions. [Learn how to use it here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/measuring-and-maximizing-impact-of-covid-19-contact-tracing).
 - [flepiMoP](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP/), the *fle*xible *epi*demic *mo*deling *p*ipeline is a full-spectrum analysis framework for managing complex infectious disease simulations, inference, and scenario projection. You can read the [documentation here](https://iddynamics.gitbook.io/flepimop).

## Cutting Edge Modeling Toolkit

In addition to bespoke modeling applications, we are constantly refining general purpose tools to be ready for the next problem. We make many of these tools publicly available, including:

 - [tabularepimdl](https://github.com/UNCIDD/tabularepimdl) the _Tabular Epidemiological Model_ framework is a model-building domain specific language (DSL) for rapid prototyping and modification of infectious disease models.
 - [paramix](https://github.com/CMMID/paramix) is a tool to properly scale parameters for compartmental modeling, a common approach to infectious disease dynamics. Read more [about the method here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.03.24318412v1).
 - [hashPRNG](https://github.com/epinowcast/hashprng) is drop-in replacement library for creating the properly matched model worlds which are necessary for high resolution scenario comparison.
